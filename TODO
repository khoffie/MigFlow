Some to-do thoughts:

1) hexbin(fromdens,todens) for zero flows showed us that a lot of them come from and go to low density regions 
We should try to make the probability of a flow drop a bunch when density in the two regions is low. 

2) drop the mixture model and actually model the individual flows using density

3) Create a Julia diagnostic plotting routine, that shows log(flow/pred) vs distance, hexbin(log(fromdens),log(todens)), maps of germany

4) Further investigation of why optimization doesn't work well

5) A new simulator for data? Use Turing prior predictive?

6) A Radial Basis Function expansion instead of Chebyshev?

7) A cloud computer with Julia and the dataset, where
